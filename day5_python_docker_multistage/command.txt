3️⃣ Why do DevOps engineers create multi-stage builds?

Think of it like making a final product in a factory:

Stage 1 = factory production line (needs all machinery/tools)

Stage 2 = packaged product ready for store (only what’s needed to run)

Advantages:

Feature	                            Single-Stage	Multi-Stage
Image size	                        Large	        Small
Build tools in final image	        Yes	            No
Security	                        Lower	        Higher
Build caching	                    Limited	        Better if structured
Production ready	                Not optimal	    ✅
